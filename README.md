23andme-relfind-compare
=======================

This utility is for comparing 23andme.com relative finder CSV export files between two persons.

On Linux, install the dependencies:
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

It should run on Windows also, but you have to install Python and
Python-matplotlib somehow. I would recommend starting with Cygwin.
